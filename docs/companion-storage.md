# Companion storage format

Nolune owns exactly one persistent companion identity and memory per server
(decision #100, implemented in #103). Connected computers, chats, and
relationship scopes are contexts of that identity, never separate companions.
This document is the reference for the on-disk layout and wire shape that
import/restore work (#74) and continuity records (#81) build on.

## Format version 1

### Canonical identity

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Canonical slug | `companion` |
| Companion directory | `~/.nolune/instances/companion/` |
| Identity marker | `instances/companion/companion.json` |
| Format version | `1` |

The identity marker is the source of truth for "this companion exists":

```json
{
  "format_version": 1,
  "slug": "companion"
}
```

Unknown fields are rejected. A marker with any other `format_version` or
`slug` is unsupported: the server refuses to read or write that companion
(HTTP `503 companion_format_unsupported`) and never rewrites the marker.

```

Every persisted subsystem (settings, soul, history, memory, scheduler, machine
bindings, export) lives under this single directory. Retired layouts
(`stats/` per-day aggregates, `agents/` child-agent configs and histories,
`agent_runs/` traces, `thoughts/` raw monologue) are removed from the
companion directory at startup and never read. The derived vector index
under `vectors/` is keyed by the same slug and can always be rebuilt from
`memory/`.

### Obsolete sibling directories

Any other directory under `instances/` is left over from the unpublished
multi-instance layout. The server:

- logs a warning listing them at startup,
- never lists, migrates, schedules, indexes, resumes, exports, or deletes them,
- rejects every request that addresses them (see below).

There are no external users of that layout, so no migration is provided.
Remove or archive those directories manually.

### Derived index recovery

`vectors/` is a derived cache keyed by the companion slug; `memory/` is the
source of truth. Recovery is automatic (#96): on startup the server asks the
index whether it `needs_backfill` (missing, corrupt, or written by another
format version) and rebuilds it from the memory files in the background,
committing only a complete candidate so the last good index stays searchable
if a provider call fails. Deleting a memory reconciles its index entries
immediately. There is no button and no manual reindex route; delete the
`vectors/` directory to force a rebuild on the next start.

### Memory recall receipts

Every assistant message keeps a bounded record of the memories that were
auto-recalled into its prompt (#84), so the client can answer "why did Nolune
remember this?" without exposing model reasoning:

```text
chats/{chat_id}/receipts/{message_id}.json
```

Each file is written atomically (temp file + rename) right after the turn and
is a derived record: `memory/` stays the source of truth. The shape:

```json
{
  "message_id": "msg_1758360000000_3",
  "chat_id": "default",
  "memories": [
    {
      "path": "about/basics.md",
      "source": "about/basics.md",
      "excerpt": "likes tea, lives in Lisbon",
      "reason": "semantic",
      "confidence": "high",
      "retrieved_at": "2026-09-20T09:00:00Z",
      "source_status": "present"
    },
    {
      "path": "photos/sky.png",
      "source": "photos/sky.png.md",
      "excerpt": "sky over Lisbon at dusk",
      "reason": "linked_to",
      "linked_from": "about/basics.md",
      "confidence": "low",
      "retrieved_at": "2026-09-20T09:00:00Z",
      "source_status": "missing"
    }
  ]
}
```

- `path` is the memory as the library shows it; `source` is the canonical
  file whose text was recalled. Media memories cite their bound text
  representation (`<media>.md`, see `media_text.rs`).
- `reason` is `semantic` (vector index), `keyword` (BM25), `linked_to` (one
  graph hop from `linked_from`), or `matched` when hybrid search cannot say
  which channel found a media memory.
- `confidence` is a bucket (`high`, `medium`, `low`); raw scores never leave
  the server.
- `source_status` is resolved again on every read: a memory that was deleted
  or moved after the turn is reported as `missing` and the receipt still
  loads. An empty `memories` list means no memory influenced that reply.

Routes (companion-scoped like every other `/api/instances/{slug}/…` path):
`GET /api/instances/{slug}/{chat_id}/receipts` lists a chat's receipts and
`GET /api/instances/{slug}/{chat_id}/receipts/{message_id}` returns one
(`404` only when no receipt exists). The transient `memory_recall` server
event carries the same `memories` entries at retrieval time.

## Wire shape

### Slug in URLs, bodies, and events

Routes keep the `instance_slug` path segment for now (`/api/instances/{slug}/…`,
`/api/chat/{slug}/…`, `/public/files/{slug}/…`, `/public/memory/{slug}/…`). The
only accepted value is `companion`, matched exactly.

- Any other slug in a path, in the `POST /api/chat` body, or in a public media
  URL returns `404 {"error":"unknown_companion"}` before any handler runs and
  has no side effects.
- `GET`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, and `DELETE` on the canonical slug never create
  storage. Any other method creates-or-opens the companion by writing the
  identity marker first.
- `GET /api/companion` returns the one companion context:
  `{"slug":"companion","exists":false,"companion_name":"","soul_exists":false}`
  until onboarding creates it, then `exists: true` with its name. `GET /api/meta`
  reports `companion_slug` and `instances_count` (`0` or `1`).
- The multi-instance listing (`GET /api/instances`) and companion deletion
  (`DELETE /api/instances/{slug}`) were removed in #104. They, and any other
  unknown `/api/*` path, answer `404 {"error":"not_found"}` after
  authentication instead of serving the web client shell.
- The client never mints a slug: `/` opens `/companion`, and a stale
  `/{other}/…` URL redirects to `/companion/…` keeping its chat or settings
  context.
- Server events (`instance_slug` fields), resource capabilities
  (`instance_slug`), and machine registrations (`MachineInfo.instance_slug`)
  always carry `companion`. A machine registration that names any other slug
  is bound to `companion`.

### Export archive

`GET /api/instances/companion/export` streams a `tar.gz` whose entries are all
rooted at `companion/` (for example `companion/companion.json`,
`companion/soul.md`, `companion/memory/…`). Import (#74) must require a valid
`companion/companion.json` with `format_version: 1` and reject archives with
any other root, slug, or version.

## Changing this format

Bump `format_version` whenever the directory layout, the marker shape, or the
export root changes, and add a read test for the previous version before
shipping the writer. Server constants live in `server/src/domain/companion.rs`;
the filesystem boundary is `server/src/services/companion.rs`, the only module
allowed to enumerate `instances/`.
